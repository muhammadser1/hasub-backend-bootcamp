# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game that evolves according to simple rules based on the initial configuration. This project implements Conway's Game of Life as a command-line interface (CLI) simulator.

## Installation

To run the Conway's Game of Life simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/conways-game-of-life.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd system_design
Install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To start the simulator, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to set the initial state of the board, specify the number of rounds to simulate, and observe the evolution of the game.

Rules
The rules of Conway's Game of Life are as follows:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

Features

Interactive command-line interface for setting up and simulating the game.
Implementation of Conway's Game of Life rules to update the board for each round.
Customizable board size and number of simulation rounds.
Visualization of the board state for each round.
