In the `main()` function located in `main.py`:
I read data from a JSON file, including information about weapons and places. If the initial attempt to read the data fails,
 I prompt the user to try again up to 5 times. This could occur due to errors in the file or if it doesn't exist in the specified path.

Additionally, I obtain the number of players using a function called `get_integer_input` located in the `utils` module.
 This function performs input validation, ensuring that the user enters a valid integer value.

Once I have the necessary data and the number of players, I initialize the game by creating an instance of the `Game` class with the obtained information:
 `Game(places, weapons, player_num, game_ui)`. Finally, I start the game.

In the start() function of the Clue_game class, I first create a player instance within the function. For each player,
 I call a function that randomly adds places using the add_visit_places(places) method. This method takes a list of places, randomly selects 1-3 places, and adds them to the player's visited list.

I've created a test case called test_player_add_visit_places to ensure the functionality of this method:

It checks if the input and the output are correct.
It handles the case when the input list of places is empty ([]).
It handles the case when the input list of places is None.
It handles the case when the input list contains only one place (["places1"]).
It verifies that the method correctly raises a TypeError when the input is of an incorrect type, such as an integer or a dictionary ({}), instead of a list ([]).

The tests I've created for adding favorite weapons to the player mirror those I've implemented for adding visited places.

After creating the players and designating one as the murderer, the generate_murder() function is called.
This function generates details of the murder for the current round by randomly selecting a murder place and a non-assassin player as the victim.
I have only written one test, but more are needed to verify if the output of the function, murder_place, is among the visited places of the murderer.
