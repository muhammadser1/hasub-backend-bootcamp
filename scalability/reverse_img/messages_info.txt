Analysis:
Single-threaded processing with PIL Image takes the least time compared to OpenCV.
Multi-threaded processing with PIL Image shows a slight improvement over the single-threaded version but doesn't scale
much with the increase in threads.
Multi-threaded processing with OpenCV shows significant improvement over the single-threaded OpenCV version, indicating
 better threading support.
Multi-processing shows improvements over multi-threading, especially with a higher number of processors, for both PIL
Image and OpenCV versions. This indicates that parallel processing with multiple processes is more effective in
 utilizing system resources compared to threads.
Overall, the choice between PIL Image and OpenCV depends on factors like ease of use, functionality, and specific
 requirements of the application. When it comes to parallel processing, multi-processing generally outperforms
 multi-threading, especially with a higher number of processors.
